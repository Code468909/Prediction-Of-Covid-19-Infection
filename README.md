# Prediction-Of-Covid-19-Infection
As we know that the whole world is affected by the coronavirus. In our project we will learn to program a “Coronavirus  Probability Detector” using python and machine learning concepts. This project is very different yet helpful for all of us in such a  pandemic situation.  We will be using Jupyter Notebook for the initial development and then create UI which tells whether the person has an infection  or not based on input features using Visual Studio Code IDE.
