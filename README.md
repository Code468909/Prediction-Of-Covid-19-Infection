# Prediction-Of-Covid-19-Infection
As we know that the whole world is affected by the coronavirus. In our project we will learn to program a “Coronavirus  Probability Detector” using python and machine learning concepts. This project is very different yet helpful for all of us in such a  pandemic situation.  We will be using Jupyter Notebook for the initial development and then create UI which tells whether the person has an infection  or not based on input features using Visual Studio Code IDE.
   Here is the link - file:///C:/Users/acer/AppData/Local/Temp/Temp1_covid.zip/covid/templates/INDEX3.HTML


SOME OF THE LIBRARIES TO INSTALL:-
NUMPY,PANDA , TENSORFLOW ,PICKEL,FLASK
We will be using Jupyter Notebook for the initial development and then create UI which tells whether the person has an infection or not based on input features using Virtual Studio Code IDE

Steps to run the project properly:-
1) In the GitHub file there is one covid zip named file you can extract it and download all the files.
Or
You can download all the files individually in your system and save it.

2) After saving all the files in your system there is a file of templates in which some images are their , what you have to do first visit the link of the website and generate new link , after that replace it from the previous link added in the header of file named index3.html because the link got expired after every 12 hours thats why it don't show the proper image on the website.

3)The last step is that in main.py folder after running the code you have to write main.py then a link will reflect in the terminal and by clicking on that link only you can see the prediction of infection otherwise it will show an error after giving the data of symptoms and after submitting it.
